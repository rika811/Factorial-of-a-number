# Factorial of a number using if-else in C

Factorial of a positive integer (number) is the sum of multiplication of all the integers smaller than that positive integer. For example, factorial of 5 is 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 which equals to 120.

Factorial Program in C: All positive descending integers are added together to determine the factor of n. Hence, n! is denoted as a Factorial of n.

A factorial is denoted by "!". So, suppose, you want to find the factorial of the number n, then n! = n * (n-1) * (n-2) * (n-3) â€¦ *.
